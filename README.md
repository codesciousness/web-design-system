Build a Website Design System is one of Codecademy's open-ended projects, in which it is encouraged to problem solve and utilize other resources, instead of being provided step-by-step guidance. The requirements were to create our own basic style guide and design system for a website in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web appplication. We were instructed to collect all the colors, fonts, and some of the repeating styles to create a consistent set of cohesive styles for future reference. This design system would help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large site, and have sections outlining the colors, fonts and text styles for page elements.

The method that I envisioned as a possible way to complete this project was to utilize a "plug-in like" sidebar, which was coded in JavaScript, that would display the styles of every major page element when hovered over for easy reference. I chose to complete the project this way because I thought it would be more efficient and help keep the style guide dynamic if styles choices were updated in the future.
